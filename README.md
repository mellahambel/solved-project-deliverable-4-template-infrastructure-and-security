<strong> </strong><strong>Project Background</strong>.

The last section of the project plan will present the infrastructure in accordance with the parameters set forth at the outset of the project. The network solution that is chosen should support the conceived information system and allow for scalability. The network infrastructure will support organizational operations; therefore, a pictorial view of workstations, servers, routers, bridges, gateways, and access points should be used. In addition, access paths for Internet access should be depicted. A narrative should be included to explain all the nodes of the network and the rationale for the design. Lastly, using the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) Triangle, define the organizational security policy. CIA is a widely used benchmark for evaluation of information systems security.

This assignment consists of two (2) sections: an infrastructure document and a revised Gantt chart or project plan. <strong>You must submit both sections as separate files for the completion of this assignment. Label each file name according to the section of the assignment</strong> for which it is written. Additionally, you may create and / or assume all necessary assumptions needed for the completion of this assignment.
